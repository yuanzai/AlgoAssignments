"""
You are given an array D of n coin denomination values d1 < d2 < â€¦ < dn, where each di is a positive integer, and a positive integer A. You have an unlimited number of coins of each denomination. Assume d1 = 1, so you can always make change for any amount of money A. Give an efficient dynamic programming program that, given A and D, makes change for A using the minimum number of coins with denominations from D.
